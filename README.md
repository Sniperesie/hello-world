Step 1 of Assignment
My name is John Peresie and this is step 3 of the assignment. I am the 5th of 6 kids and my parents have been married for over 50 years. I have been married 7 years and have a 3 year old boy. We love going on walks, playing in the backyard, and snuggling on the couch. I am a huge sports fan and also enjoy craft beer and bourbon.
